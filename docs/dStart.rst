How do I select what to work on?
--------------------------------

We recommend that you begin by translating Open Bible Stories. You can work your way through the Stories however you want, but we have found that Story #31 (see https://door43.org/en/obs/31) is a good first story to translate since it is short and easy to understand. For more information read `Choosing What to Translate <https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/translationStudio-Info/blob/master/docs/ChoosingWhatToTranslate.rst>`_.

How do I start a translation project?
------------------------------

The definition of a translation project consists of:

1. Specifying the **target language** - the language *into which* you will be translating

2. Selecting a **project category** - *what* you will be translating, such as Open Bible Stories or a book of the Bible

3. Choosing a **source text** - the language and text *from which* you will be translating, such as the English ULB (Unlocked Literal Bible)

To start a translation project, you must specify each of these elements.

Begin by clicking the blue plus sign on the home screen to start defining a new project. When you first start using translationStudio,
there is also a green **Start a New Translation** button on the home screen that you can click to start a new project. (The Start a New Project button is available only if you have not previously created any projects.)



How do I select the target language?
--------------------------------------

All translationStudio projects require a target language (the mother tongue language *into which* you will be translating). When you create a new project, the first step is selecting the target language, so translationStudio presents you with a language list that is alphabetical by the language code shown in the right column of the list.

To choose your target language (the one you will be translating to), you can either scroll down the language list to find the target language OR you can search for the target language. To search, perform the following steps:

1.	In the search field and the top left of the language list, type the first few letters of your language to narrow the list. 
 
2.	Click your target language to select it.
 
What if I cannot find the desired target language?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you do not see your language in the list of target languages, first try alternate spellings, dialect names, and any variant names for your language. If you still can't find it, you can request that your language be added.

The best way to submit a request is to send an email to help@door43.org. Another method is to use the Feedback option from the options menu to submit a Bug Report. In either case, please provide as much information as you can about the language, such as the local name of the language, any other names it is known by, approximate number of speakers, where it is spoken, any similar languages, any published works in that language, etc.

To use Feedback in the 3-dot options menu to request a new language:

1. From any screen in translationStudio, tap the 3-dot icon on the left or bottom.

2. In the list of options, click Feedback.

3. The Feedback screen opens. Type the name of the language you would like added to translationStudio. Provide the location pf the speakers and other names the language is known by. If you used a language that is already in the APP, tell which language you used.

4. Click Confirm to send your request.

**Note**: Even after requesting a new language, certain approvals are required before it will be added to translationStudio. Until your language is added to the app, use English Demo1 or English Demo2. You will need to use the Feedback option from the options menu to send a comment stating that you used another language in place of your own. Once your translation has been received, the tS workers will put it in the correct language. Your translation will then show in your language.
    
Can I change the target language of an existing project?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you make a mistake and designate the wrong target language, after you have finished defining the project you can change the target language.

1. On the Home page, click the "i" icon next to the project whose target language you wish to change.

2. On the information window, Click **Change** next to the target language.
 
3. The *Choose target language* window appears, enabling you to select a different target language. As soon as you select a language, a message displays to tell you the change is complete. 

How do I select the project category?
---------------------------------------
When you create a new project, the next step is selecting the project category, which is the type of project you will be working on, such as a book of the Bible, Open Bible Stories, or one of the translation resource (notes, words, or questions).

To designate what to work on for this project, complete the following steps:

1.	Choose a project from the **Old Testament**, **New Testament**, or **Other** to start translating. (The Other category is for Open Bible Stories or translationWords.)

2.	The next step depends on the category you chose:

    * If you chose either the Old or New Testament:
      
      * You next choose a book for the project.
 
      * If you are in Gateway Language Mode, you then also must select the type of translation – will you be translating text of either the ULB or UDB, or will you be translating Notes or Questions? (If translating Notes or Questions, you must first create a text project for the same target language/Bible book and then create a project for Notes or Questions.)

  *	If you chose Other, you next choose to translate either Open Bible Stories, translationWords (these are from the Bible), or translationWords OBS (these are from Open Bible Stories). The last two types are available only in Gateway Language Mode (See *How do I set up to translate Bible resources?* in `translationStudio for the Desktop `<https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/translationStudio-Info/blob/master/docs/desktop.rst>`_.)

How do I select or change the source text? 
-----------------------------------------------------

After selecting the category and type, the project is created and opens. If it is a translationWords project, it automatically uses an English source text. However, in other types of projects you need to select a source text before you can begin to translate. This is the text you will be translating *from*.

You can add or change source texts at any time while working in the project. You are not able to work in a project until you choose a source text language.

**Note**: If you are doing Gateway translation, be sure to select English (en) Unlocked Literal Bible as your source text. This is the source that has the resources (notes, words, and questions) attached to it.

In the translation project, complete the following steps to select or change the source text language:

1. Click the rectangular icon with the + and - sign  found at the top right of the project window (or at the top right of a previously-chosen source text).
 
2. Click the empty square box next to the desired source text and language. You can scroll down to see additional texts, or search by using the magnifying glass icon at the upper right of the *Choose source translations* box.

3. To save the selection(s), tap **Confirm** at the bottom right of the *Choose source translations* box, OR tap **Cancel** to close without saving the selected language.
 
**Note**: You can choose multiple source texts; those selected are moved to the top portion of the *Choose source translations* box under the *Selected* heading. 
 
  * Choosing multiple source texts enables you to compare them as you are performing the translation work. 
  
  * For example, when translating the Bible you should always choose the Unlocked Literal Bible (ULB) in the source language, but you may want to also choose the Unlocked Dynamic Bible (UDB) if it is available in your language because it may be easier to understand. Looking at the UDB may help you to translate or check a passage.
 
.. warning:: You are not able to work in a project until you choose a source text.
