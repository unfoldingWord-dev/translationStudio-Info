This answers the question: What are generic noun phrases and how can I translate them?

In order to understand this topic, it would be good to read:

Parts of Speech
Generic noun phrases refer to people or things in general rather than to specific individuals or things.

The underlined phrases above do not refer to any specific people but to anyone who does what is right or anyone who is wicked.

Description

Reason this is a translation issue

Examples from the Bible
People curse the man who refuses to sell them grain (Proverbs 11:26 ULB)
This does not refer to a particular man, but to any person who refuses to sell grain.

Yahweh gives favor to a good man, but he condemns a man who makes evil plans. (Proverbs 12:2 ULB) 
The phrase "a good man" does not refer to a particular man, but to any person who is good. The phrase "a man who makes evil plans" does not refer to a particular man, but to any person who makes evil plans.
