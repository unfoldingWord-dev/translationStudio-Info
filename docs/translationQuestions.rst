The white square or rectangle boxes are known as cards. Each of the cards in a row contains the information pertaining to the same chunk, or part of, the chapter.

Navigation:
^^^^^^^^^^^

On the left in the green bar are the navigation tools. Here is the action when each is used:

* Top up-arrow against line –  go to the beginning of the book

* Open up-arrow (chevron) – back one chapter in the book (the navigation is up or before in the book)

* Closed up-arrow – back one chunk in the book (or before in the book than the top chunk shown)

* White box – type in the chapter number, press enter, to go directly to that chapter.

* Closed down-arrow – forward one chunk in the book (or after in the book than the top chunk shown)

* Open down-arrow (chevron) – forward one chapter in the book (the navigation is down or later in the book)

* Top down-arrow against line – go to the end of the book

Columns:
^^^^^^^^

* 1st column – This is the English ULB source text. Use this as a reference tool or guide on what the notes or questions are referring to.

* 2nd column – This is the Gateway Language translation of the book. The verses on the card of this translation should align with the verses on the English card.

* 3rd column – This is the working column
* 4th column – Tabs with the resources for the English ULB.
 
**HINT**: You might want to arrange the window so that the right 3 columns are visible at the same time.

**HINT**: You might want to move the rows of cards so that the row being worked on is placed at the top of the window.
 
To work in the 3rd column:

1.      To create a new card - click the plus sign located on the top bar on the right side. Notice that the first card can be created by clicking on the plus sign in the middle of the gray space in the row.

2.      To delete a card – click on the X in the top right of the card.

3.      To move a card up or down on the row - click on the up or down triangle arrows.  Note that cards cannot be moved from one row to another.
 
Remember to always write the questions in a way that will be consistent and clear to the translator.
