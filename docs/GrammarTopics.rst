Grammar Topics
==============

Grammar has two main parts: words and structure. Structure involves how we put words together to form phrase, clauses, and sentences.

**Parts of Speech** - All words in a language belong to a category called a part of speech. (See: `Parts of Speech <https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/translationStudio-Info/blob/master/docs/PartsOfSpeech.rst>`_)

**Sentences** - When we speak, we organize our thoughts in sentences. A sentence usually has a complete thought about an event or a situation or state of being. (See: `Sentence Structure <https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/translationStudio-Info/blob/master/docs/SentenceStructure.rstA>`_)

* Sentences can be statements, questions, commands or exclamations. (See: `Sentence Types <https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/translationStudio-Info/blob/master/docs/SentenceTypes.rst>`_)
* Sentences can have more than one clause. (See: `Sentence Structure <https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/translationStudio-Info/blob/master/docs/SentenceStructure.rstA>`_)
* Some languages have both active and passive sentences (See: `Active or Passive <https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/translationStudio-Info/blob/master/docs/ActiveOrPassive.rst>`_)

**Possession** - This shows that there is a relationship between two nouns. In English it is marked with "of" as in "the love of God," or with "'s" as in "God's love," or with a possessive pronoun as in "his love." (See Possession)

**Quotations** - A quotation is a report of what someone else has said. 

 * Quotations normally have two parts: Information about who said something and what the person said. (See: `Quotations and Quote Margins <https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/translationStudio-Info/blob/master/docs/QuoteMargins.rst>`_) 

* Quotations can be either direct quotes or indirect quotes (See: `Direct and Indirect Quotations <https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/translationStudio-Info/blob/master/docs/DirectIndirectQuotations.rst>`_)

* Quotes can have quotes within them (See: `Quotes within Quotes <https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/translationStudio-Info/blob/master/docs/QuotesWithinQuotes.rst>`_)

* Quotes can be marked to make it easy for readers to understand who said what. (See `Quote Markings <https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/translationStudio-Info/blob/master/docs/QuoteMarkings.rst>`_)
